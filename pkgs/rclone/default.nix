# Introduce a vendored-in expression of a (more recent version of) rclone,
# including the patch for socket activation sent upstream at
# https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/7801.
#
# The patch doesn't apply cleanly on 1.64.2 (what our nixpkgs points to),
# and would result in a change of vendorHash (only in this old version).
#
# Overriding vendorHash using overrideAttrs is broken, due to
# https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/86349.
#
# Just vendor in a (simplified) expression. Can be replaced with just the patch
# once nixpkgs moves to 23.05.
